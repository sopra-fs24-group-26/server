## Pattern
**Issue:** "Userstory: Issue Summary" <br>
**Branch:** "Issuenumber-issue-description" [^1] <br>
**Commit:** "Issuenumber: Commit message" <br>
**PR:** "Userstory: PR/Issue description" <br>

[^1]: This should get out-created by GitHub when fomring a branch for an issue

## Workflow
1. Create Userstories
2. Create architecture through in person meeting.
3. Create issues based on userstories, connecting them in development tasks.
4. Assign issues to members.
5. Members create branches and commit changes.
6. Members open pull requests which the others review.
7. When merged, issue gets closed.

## Formatting
- Generally good structuring in folders (for example for all DTOs)
- Generally small functions and classes
- For TS: Prettier formatting
- For Java: still to find out
