# Saboteur Web Version

A webversion of the board game Saboteur, project for the Software Engineering Lab FS24 at UZH. <br>
Our focus was to implement something that would exite us, leading to the creation of a simple web version of a fun board game we had played together

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Pattern
**Issue:** "Userstory: Issue Summary" <br>
**Branch:** "Issuenumber-issue-description" [^1] <br>
**Commit:** "Issuenumber: Commit message" <br>
**PR:** "Userstory: PR/Issue description" <br>

[^1]: This should get auto generated by GitHub when forming a branch for an issue

## Workflow
1. Create Userstories
2. Create architecture through in person meeting.
3. Create issues based on userstories, connecting them in development tasks.
4. Assign issues to members.
5. Members create branches and commit changes.
6. Members open pull requests which the others review.
7. When merged, issue gets closed.

## Formatting
- Generally good structuring in folders (for example for all DTOs)
- Generally small functions and classes
- For TS: Prettier formatting
- For Java: still to find out
